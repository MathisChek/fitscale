#                     Raise your arms up and turn the rope over your head bringing it down in front of you.
#                     When it reaches the ground, jump over it. Find a good turning pace that can be maintained.
#                     Different speeds and techniques can be used to introduce variation.
#                     Rope jumping is exciting, challenges your coordination, and requires a lot of energy.
#                     A 150 lb person will burn about 350 calories jumping rope for 30 minutes,
#                     compared to over 450 calories running."}
